        <h2>About BC Wares</h2>
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>
                <strong>BC Wares</strong> is a curated marketplace for local, handcrafted goods made by talented
                artisans, creators, and
                small
                businesses. Launched by the parent company Brainless Genius, <strong>BC Wares</strong> was built with
                one goal in mind:
                to
                shine
                a
                spotlight on local creativity and craftsmanship without the noise and clutter of massive online
                platforms.
            </p>

            <p>
                We believe in meaningful, slow-made products. Our mission is to provide a platform where makers can
                showcase
                their
                work without getting lost in the endless scroll of sites like Etsy or eBay. Every item on BC Wares is a
                reflection
                of passion, skill, and individuality â€” not mass production.
            </p>

            <p>
                We're proud to support local businesses and help you discover something truly unique. Whether it's
                hand-thrown
                ceramics, woodwork, textiles, or homegrown wellness products, you'll find treasures that are as genuine
                as
                the
                people who made them.
            </p>

            <p>
                Support local. Shop with purpose. Discover something real.
            </p>

                <strong>Welcome to BC Wares.</strong>
